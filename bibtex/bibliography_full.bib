  abstract = {Purpose: Despite major advances in high-resolution retinal imaging
	with adaptive optics (AO), less than 0.2\% of human retinal cells
	have been visualized in vivo. The short axial extent and very small
	index mismatch of retinal cells make detection extremely difficult.
	We have developed an en-face coherence gated camera equipped with
	AO that aims to provide improved sensitivity and axial resolution.
	
	Methods: Coherence gating in the retina camera was realized with a
	free-space Michelson interferometer that employed a superluminescent
	diode for illuminating the retina; voice coil and piezo-electric
	translators in the reference channel for controlling the gate position;
	and a CCD array for recording 2-D retinal interferograms. En-face
	slices of the retina were obtained using a four-step phase shift
	reconstruction method. The camera was capable of collecting four
	interferograms in 7 msec. The AO system deployed a 37-actuator Xinetics
	mirror and a {S}hack-{H}artmann wavefront sensor that provided dynamic
	correction. The dynamic range and axial point spread width of the
	system were measured by positioning a planar mirror in the sample
	channel and sweeping the reference mirror. Through-gating images
	were collected on a model eye that consisted of a 17 mm achromatic
	lens, a 7 mm pupil, and an in vitro bovine fundus containing intact
	retina, choriod and sclera. Preliminary reconstructions were obtained
	on the in vivo human retina.
	
	Results: Axial width of the point spread and dynamic range of the
	camera were measured near 10 microns and 40 dB, respectively, which
	is substantially better than current confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopes
	(cSLOs) equipped with AO. Reconstructions of the in vitro bovine
	retina revealed clear layering of the fundus tissue with a measured
	retinal thickness of 365 microns and well-defined blood vessels of
	54 microns diameter.
	
	Conclusions: Early results suggest that a coherence gated AO camera
	should substantially improve our ability to detect single cells in
	the retina over the current state-of-the-art AO retina cameras, including
	conventional flood illumination and cSLOs. To our knowledge, this
	is the first effort to combine coherence gating and AO.},

  note = {E-Abstract: 1955},
  abstract = {Purpose:
	
	Phototransduction initiates the neural visual process and represents
	a key facet in our understanding of vision and ocular disease. Existing
	methods for in vivo measurement of phototransduction, however, have
	limited spatial and temporal resolution (and what does this prevent?).
	Recently, we have shown that scintillation in the reflectance of
	individual cones, i.e. a rapid oscillation in the cone's reflectance,
	emerges under certain imaging conditions [1,2]. We hypothesize that
	this optical phenomenon may be linked to specific stages in the phototransduction
	process. As such, we investigate the spatial and temporal behavior
	of the scintillation of individual cones using a high speed adaptive
	optics retina camera.
	
	
	
	Methods:
	
	Videos of the cone mosaic at 1.4 degrees eccentricity were acquired
	at 192 Hz and over 2 s intervals using an adaptive optics retina
	camera (similar to [2]). The imaging source was a superluminescent
	diode ($\lambda$ = 835 nm, $\Delta\lambda$ = 18.7 nm) whose temporal coherence length
	could be adjusted using spectral filters. In some trials a single
	stimulus flash (wavelength?) of 4 to 6 ms and XX trolands was presented
	during imaging of the cone mosaic. The spectral filters and ?separate
	sources? provided two independent variables (comment: what is the
	purpose of the two independent variables, i.e. what are you trying
	to do with them?), and measurements were taken under the four corresponding
	conditions (What are you trying to answer with this experiment, i.e.,
	what is its purpose?).
	
	
	Results:
	
	Stimulus (comment: single or multiple flash?, How much bleaching occurred?)
	was found to be necessary to elicit scintillation, and amount of
	scintillation was found to depend upon coherence length of the imaging
	source. The effect of stimulus was assessed by comparing the scintillation
	contrast before and after stimulus. Averaged over 400 randomly chosen
	cones, the stimulus increased the scintillation by a factor of 0.6
	($p<10^{-8}$ with $\alpha = .01$). The effect was considerably more significant
	when examining individual cones. Scintillation appears to stop after
	100 ms, with a minimum time-to-peak of 20-25ms.
	
	
	Conclusion:
	
	Results support the hypothesis that phototransduction is linked to
	cone scintillation. Average time course of the scintillation is consistent
	with cone ERG measurements. Variations between cones may be attributable
	to spectral class differences.}

	signatures},
  journal = IOVS,
  year = {2006},
  volume = {47},
  note = {E-Abstract 1806},
  abstract = {Purpose:
	
	A method for classifying cone photoreceptors has been demonstrated,
	relying on the spectral properties of the cone classes and the absorptive
	effects of bleaching [1]. This method, however, requires multiple
	images over 24 hours to achieve sufficient signal-to-noise. Recently,
	we have shown that several unique patterns of cone scintillation,
	near 1 Hz, emerge under certain imaging conditions [2]. An interference
	model, based on refractive index changes of the outer segment during
	bleaching, predicts similar unique scintillation signatures for the
	three cone classes [3]. This model may allow rapid cone classification
	if techniques are developed to correlate observed and predicted scintillations.
	Such techniques are evaluated here using experimental data.
	
	
	Methods:
	
	Cone mosaic images were acquired using an adaptive optics retina camera
	(described in [2] and [3]) at 30 Hz over 3 sec intervals, with a
	670 nm source used for simultaneous bleaching and imaging.
	
	
	Registered images representing the temporal mean and RMS intensity
	level were generated. Cone identification was automated, and temporal
	reflectance profiles were extracted. Characteristics of the profiles
	were computed in order to partition the cones according to scintillation
	temporal dynamics.
	
	
	Results:
	
	Distributions of scintillation characteristics were noticeably clustered
	for those profiles with high fluctuations, e.g. the 20\% of the cones
	with highest signal. Clustering reduced as the number of cones considered
	was increased.
	
	
	Conclusion:
	
	Methods for classifying cones based upon bleaching-dependent scintillation
	show promise as a way of classifying cone photoreceptors using a
	3 second measurement. Moreover these methods allow direct measurement
	of the ratio of cones of different classes, assuming that the magnitude
	of the signal generated by an individual cone is uncorrelated with
	its class.

	self-interference phenomenon is highly sensitive to phase changes
	such as those caused by variations in refractive index and scatter

	fps, corresponding to a full field 1024x512 pixel rate of 100 MHz,
	may be sufficient for observing these early stages of phototransduction.
	This pixel rate is at least 80 and 10 times faster than current flood-illumination

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been rapid progress in understanding the
	properties and mechanism of generation of the light-evoked electrical
	signals of vertebrate rods and cones. The graded hyperpolarization
	that carries information over the length of the cell is generated
	by closure of cation-selective aqueous pores in the surface membrane
	of the outer segment. These pores are controlled cooperatively by
	cyclic GMP, which acts continuously in darkness to keep the pores
	open. Photoisomerization of rhodopsin or cone pigment produces the
	rapid amplified activation of phosphodiesterase, which lowers the
	concentration of cGMP, thereby lowering the conductance of the surface
	membrane. Calcium ions, once thought to relay excitation to the light-
	sensitive channels, do not play this role. Instead, they appear to
	participate in a feedback control mechanism that regulates the nucleotide
	cascade. Although some general features of the transduction mechanism
	are now understood, a number of important questions remain. How is
	the nucleotide cascade shut off? Where does Ca act? What is the structure
	of the light-sensitive channel? How are stereotyped single photon
	responses produced? Primate photoreceptors are no longer off limits
	to single cell electrophysiology. Analysis of the response properties
	and dark noise of primate rods gives a physiological basis for several
	fundamental features of human rod vision: single photon detection,
	poor temporal resolution, the "dark light," rod saturation, scotopic
	spectral sensitivity, and, perhaps, after-image signals. Primate
	cones show less sensitive but faster responses shaped by a resonance
	which may figure in the flicker sensitivity of human cone vision.
	The spectral sensitivity of the three types of primate cones has
	been determined over the entire visible region. These sensitivities
	satisfactorily predict human color matching. The spectral sensitivity
	curves indicate that the pigment in a given cone is very pure, and
	that individual cones of a given type normally contain pigments with
	very similar or identical spectral properties.},

	Spectra were obtained from five 'blue', twenty 'green', and sixteen
	'red' cones. The wave-lengths of maximum sensitivity were approximately
	430, 531 and 561 nm, respectively. 4. The spectra of the three types

	for the existence of subclasses of cones with different spectral
	sensitivities. Within a class, the positions of the individual spectra

	1.5 nm. 6. Psychophysical results on human colour matching (Stiles

	projecting from small pieces of retina. Light flashes evoked transient
	outward-going photocurrents with saturating amplitudes of up to 34
	pA. A flash causing twenty to fifty photoisomerizations gave a response
	of half the saturating amplitude. The response-stimulus relation
	was of the form 1-e-x where x is flash strength. The response to
	a dim flash usually had a time to peak of 150-250 ms and resembled
	the impulse response of a series of six low-pass filters. From the
	average spectral sensitivity of ten rods the rhodopsin was estimated
	to have a peak absorption near 491 nm. The spectral sensitivity of
	the rods was in good agreement with the average human scotopic visibility
	curve determined by Crawford (1949), when the human curve was corrected
	for lens absorption and self-screening of rhodopsin. Fluctuations
	in the photocurrent evoked by dim lights were consistent with a quantal
	event about 0.7 pA in peak amplitude. A steady light causing about
	100 photoisomerizations s-1 reduced the flash sensitivity to half
	the dark-adapted value. At higher background levels the rod rapidly
	saturated. These results support the idea that dim background light
	desensitizes human scotopic vision by a mechanism central to the
	rod outer segments while scotopic saturation may occur within the
	outer segments. Recovery of the photocurrent after bright flashes
	was marked by quantized step-like events. The events had the properties
	expected if bleached rhodopsin in the disks occasionally caused an
	abrupt blockage of the dark current over about one-twentieth of the
	length of the outer segment. It is suggested that superposition of
	these events after bleaching may contribute to the threshold elevation
	measured psychophysically. The current in darkness showed random
	fluctuations which disappeared in bright light. The continuous component
	of the noise had a variance of about 0.03 pA2 and a power spectrum
	that fell to half near 3 Hz. A second component, consisting of discrete
	events resembling single-photon responses, was estimated to occur
	at a rate of 0.006 s-1. It is suggested that the continuous component
	of the noise may be removed from scotopic vision by a thresholding
	operation near the rod output.},

	signal') associated with a stoichiometric binding between photoexcited
	rhodopsin and a peripheral membrane protein, the GTP-binding protein,
	in bovine rod outer segment suspensions. We have attempted here to
	identify the rhodopsin intermediate R* which is responsible for this
	interaction, by studying its dependence on pH, temperature and ionic
	strength. The results strongly suggest that the active state is metarhodopsin
	II (M II). 1. The initial phase of the binding signal is slightly
	slower than the formation of metarhodopsin II (2-37 degrees C, pH
	5.5-9). 2. The kinetics of the decay of the active rhodopsin state
	are similar to those of the metarhodopsin II leads to metarhodopsin
	III transition (37 degrees C, pH 7.3). 3. All conditions which lead
	to light-induced binding of the GTP-binding protein to R* also lead
	to the formation of M II. At 2 degrees C, pH 8.3, in particular where
	no M II is formed in the absence of GTP-binding protein, binding
	signals and light-induced attachment of the GTP-binding protein to
	the membrane are still observed. Consistently, addition of GTP-binding
	protein to a suspension of extracted membranes bleached at 2 degrees
	C (pH 8.3) shifts the metarhodopsin I in equilibrium metarhodopsin
	II equilibrium towards metarhodopsin II. The shift is reversed by
	GTP, which dissociates the rhodopsin--GTP-binding protein complex.
	4. At low ionic strength, where the GTP-binding protein is soluble
	in the dark (instead of being associated to the membrane as in the
	above experiments) M II still induces the binding whereas M I does
	not, indicating a much lower affinity of the GTP-binding protein

	approximately the level required to saturate the in vivo receptor
	potential. (b) Light suppression is seen in NaCl but not in KCl solutions.
	(c) Dark swelling is labile and is enhanced by calf serum, low calcium
	concentrations, dithiothreitol, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase
	inhibitors. (d) Lowering the pH to 5.5 or removing magnesium reversibly
	reduces dark swelling to the same extent as illumination. (e) The
	amount of light required for maximal suppression of dark-swelling
	increases approximately 10-fold if the calcium concentrations is
	lowered by EGTA addition. (f) The effect of illumination is irreversibly
	abolished by antimycin and other inhibitors of mitochondrial electron
	transport. (g) A process analogous to dark adaptation in vivo can
	be observed: If 10-50\% of the rhodopsin present is bleached and
	the outer segments are then kept dark, rapid dark swelling returns
	after a period of 15-45 min. This swelling is again sensitive to
	light. We tentatively ascribe the light suppression of swelling to
	the same decrease in sodium permeability which is observed on illuminating
	living receptor cells. The experiments suggest that outer segments
	retain their competence to perform both transduction and dark adaptation

  volume = {24},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match
	two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from
	different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large
	systems which evaluate images require the registration of images,
	or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific
	examples of systems where image registration is a significant component
	include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target
	recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images,
	matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation,
	and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.
	Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for
	various types of data and problems. These techniques have been independently
	studied for several different applications, resulting in a large
	body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing
	the relationship between the variations in the images and the type
	of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied.
	Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type
	are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause
	the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation
	is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations
	which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined
	by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation
	class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken.
	The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences
	in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and
	atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values,
	but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The
	third type of variations are differences in the images that are of
	interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes.
	Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed
	by registration, but they make registration more difficult since
	an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical
	that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about
	the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of
	feature space, similarity measure, search space, and search strategy
	which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques
	can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework
	is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between
	the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the
	selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. The monkey photopic ERG was studied during administration
	of glutamate analogs to determine whether the photopic a-wave derives
	exclusively from photoreceptors. METHODS. Monkey photopic ERGs were
	elicited using 200-msec flashes or 30-microseconds xenon photostrobe
	flashes on a steady light-adapting background of 40 cd/m2 (3.3 log
	scotopic troland). Intravitreal injections of APB, PDA, or both were
	given to block transmission to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing second-order
	retinal neurons, respectively. RESULTS. After injecting PDA to block
	light responses of horizontal cells and hyperpolarizing bipolar cells,
	part of the photopic a-wave was eliminated. The PDA-sensitive component,
	presumed to be due to activity postsynaptic to cones, was responsible
	for the photopic a-wave threshold and dominated the response over
	the initial 1 to 1.5 log units of intensity. For brighter stimuli,
	this component made a constant contribution to the photopic a-wave.
	A non-PDA-sensitive contribution to the a-wave, presumed to originate
	directly from cones, was first evident 1 to 1.5 log units above photopic
	a-wave threshold. It progressively dominated the a-wave at higher
	intensities, particularly at early time points after the flash. Injecting
	PDA almost eliminated the photopic a-wave elicited with bright xenon
	photostrobe flashes that are commonly used for human clinical ERG
	diagnostic testing, indicating that this a-wave may contain significant
	postreceptoral activity. CONCLUSION. The primate photopic ERG a-wave
	derives, in part, from retinal activity postsynaptic to cone photoreceptors,
	particularly for stimuli near the photopic ERG threshold that are
	typically used for human clinical studies.},

  abstract = {There is enormous variation in the X-linked L/M (long/middle wavelength
	sensitive) gene array underlying "normal" color vision in humans.
	This variability has been shown to underlie individual variation
	in color matching behavior. Recently, red-green color blindness has
	also been shown to be associated with distinctly different genotypes.
	This has opened the possibility that there may be important phenotypic
	differences within classically defined groups of color blind individuals.
	Here, adaptive optics retinal imaging has revealed a mechanism for
	producing dichromatic color vision in which the expression of a mutant
	cone photopigment gene leads to the loss of the entire corresponding
	class of cone photoreceptor cells. Previously, the theory that common
	forms of inherited color blindness could be caused by the loss of
	photoreceptor cells had been discounted. We confirm that remarkably,
	this loss of one-third of the cones does not impair any aspect of
	vision other than color.},

  title = {Different genetic causes of red\&x2212; green color blindness give
	rise to different retinal phenotypes as assessed with adaptive optics},
  year = {2004},
  abstract = {Purpose: Historically, two competing models for red–green color vision
	defects have been considered. The replacement model hypothesizes
	that L and M photoreceptors are preserved, but the normal photopigment
	of one class is replaced either with an anomalous pigment or with
	a pigment from the opposite class. The loss model hypothesizes that
	one entire class of photoreceptor is lost. Recent evidence reveals
	that a variety of genetic causes of red–green color vision deficiency
	exist, ranging from deletion of genes encoding one class of photopigment,
	to the presence of genes encoding non–functional pigment. This genetic
	heterogeneity is compatible with both the loss and replacement models,
	depending on the precise genetic defect. Here we used adaptive optics
	to directly assess the cone photoreceptor mosaic in individuals with
	genetically defined color vision defects to determine whether different
	genetic scenarios were consistent with the replacement versus the
	loss model.
	
	
	Methods: Color vision phenotypes were determined based on color matching
	performance on an anomaloscope (Oculus, HMC) in addition to standard
	color vision tests. The genetic cause of each subject's defect was
	determined using previously described methods. Retinal images of
	the cone mosaic were obtained using adaptive optics, and cone density
	was compared to that of color normals.
	
	
	Results: A number of genetic causes for red–green color blindness
	were identified. A deuteranope, whose defect was caused by an inactivating
	mutation in his M–gene had areas of retina devoid of waveguiding
	cones, resulting in a peak cone density ~30\% below normal, consistent
	with a loss model. The anomalous trichromats and single–gene dichromats
	we examined had cone densities within normal limits, consistent with
	the replacement model.
	
	
	Conclusions: This finding provides the first direct demonstration
	that color blindness can arise from the loss of an entire class of
	photoreceptor, as well as from the replacement of one class by another.},

  number = {5},
  abstract = {Purpose:By increasing the resolution of retinal imaging systems, adaptive
	optics (AO) allows the routine in vivo imaging of the cone photoreceptors.
	However, the rod photoreceptors, which have inner segment diameters
	smaller than all but the smallest foveal cones, have never been resolved
	in images of living human retina. Our goal was to see if this imaging
	modality could be extended to visualize rods.
	
	
	Methods:The Rochester Adaptive Optics Ophthalmoscope was used to image
	photoreceptors at 5 and 10o eccentricities in the temporal retina
	on the horizontal meridian. Multiple images were taken with 550 and
	670 nm light through a 6.8 mm pupil. These images were registered
	and summed to increase signal to noise ratio. Deconvolution was used
	to further enhance the image contrast.
	
	
	Results:For all 5 subjects, small, dim spots could be resolved between
	the larger, brighter cones in some, but not all, retinal locations.
	These faint spots could be distinguished from noise because they
	could be observed in repeated images of the same retinal location
	and their spacing and eccentricity dependence agreed with histological
	estimates of rod spacing (Curcio, 1990).
	
	
	Conclusions:Our results support the notion that adaptive optics imaging
	can occasionally resolve the smallest photoreceptors in the living
	human eye. The spacing between rod receptors in these retinal regions
	is about 2.8 microns which corresponds to a sampling frequency of
	about 105 cycles/deg. This is about half of 215 cycles/deg, the highest
	spatial frequency that can theoretically be resolved in an eye at
	this pupil size (6.8 mm) and wavelength (550 nm). Though the current
	imaging capability does not yet allow routine imaging of rods, future
	improvements could make it possible to image them in retinal disease.

	There is also evidence that light originating behind the receptors

	of the cone mosaic should be greatly reduced with increasing wavelength.
	This hypothesis was tested by imaging the light distributions in
	both the planes of the photoreceptors and the pupil at three wavelengths,
	550, 650, and 750 nm, with the Rochester adaptive optics ophthalmoscope.
	Surprisingly, the contrast of the retinal images varied only slightly
	with wavelength. Furthermore, the ratio of the receptorally guided
	component to the total reflected light measured in the pupil plane
	was found to be similar at each wavelength, suggesting that, throughout

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To relate in vivo microscopic retinal changes to visual function
	in patients who have various forms of retinal dystrophy. METHODS:
	The UC Davis Adaptive Optics (AO) fundus camera was used to acquire
	in vivo retinal images at the cellular level. Visual function tests
	consisting of visual fields, multifocal electroretinography (mfERG),
	and contrast sensitivity were measured in all subjects by using stimuli
	that were coincident with areas imaged. Five patients with different
	forms of retinal dystrophy and three control subjects were recruited.
	Cone densities were quantified for all retinal images. RESULTS: In
	all images of diseased retinas, there were extensive areas of dark
	space between groups of photoreceptors, where no cone photoreceptors
	were evident. These irregular features were not seen in healthy retinas,
	but were apparent in patients with retinal dystrophy. There were
	significant correlations between functional vision losses and the
	extent to which these irregularities, quantified by cone density,
	occurred in retinal images. CONCLUSIONS: AO fundus imaging is a reliable
	technique for assessing and quantifying the changes in the photoreceptor
	layer as disease progresses. Furthermore, this technique can be useful
	in cases where visual function tests provide borderline or ambiguous
	results, as it allows visualization of individual photoreceptors.},

	primitive and remains closely tied to the methods used to measure
	structure, it
	
	seemed best to organize the review so as to discuss the contributions
	from the
	
	various methods individually; this organization is followed except
	in rare in-
	
	stances where more than one technique provided information about a
	single
	
	structural event. This review concentrates on experiments carried
	out with a time
	
	resolution in the millisecond range rather than on those measuring
	changes that
	
	occur over minutes or hours; changes that occur in days or months
	have been dis-
	
	cussed elsewhere (229). Although I have tried to provide references
	for each of the
	
	techniques used to measure changes in neuron structure, a comprehensive
	literature
	
	review was not attempted. Earlier reviews on this subject were written
	by Ludkovs-
	
	kaya (192), T o b ias and Nelson (270), and Frank (103). Chemical
	changes that
	
	occur during learning (see 120), metabolic events that support neuron
	activity
	
	(see 230), and transmitter synthesis and transport are not discussed.
	The review
	
	was completed in May 1972.},

  abstract = {1. To obtain information about structural events that occur in axons,
	changes in light scattering from squid giant axons were measured
	during action potentials and voltage-clamp steps.
	
	
	2. The scattering changes were measured at several scattering angles.
	Because the changes in scattering divided by the resting scattering
	were between 10-6 and 10-5, signal-averaging techniques were used
	to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
	
	
	3. The scattering changes during the action potential were different
	at different angles. Two types were found, one at 10-30° (forward
	angles) and the other at 60-120° (right angles).
	
	
	4. At forward angles, there was a transient scattering decrease during
	the action potential. The time course of the change was similar to
	that of the action potential; this change was thought to be potential-dependent.
	
	
	5. At right angles, there was a transient scattering increase during
	the action potential followed later by a second, longer-lasting increase.
	Indirect evidence indicated that neither component could be totally
	potential-dependent.
	
	
	6. To further analyse these effects, scattering was measured during
	voltage-clamp steps. The changes seen during hyperpolarizing steps
	were presumed to be potential-dependent; again two different changes
	were found, one at forward angles and one at right angles.
	
	
	7. The potential-dependent change at right angles occurred with a
	time course that could be approximated by a single exponential with
	a time constant {tau} = 24 µsec. The change at forward angles required
	two exponentials, {tau}1 = 23 µsec, {tau}2 = 900 µsec, to represent
	its time course.
	
	
	8. The size of both potential-dependent changes was proportional to
	the square of potential. The change at right angles, but not that
	at forward angles, was increased in size by the addition of butanol
	or octanol to the bathing solution.},

	are slower, and thus more likely to represent to secondary effects

	foveal cones onto individual ganglion cells is an important mechanism
	for preserving high resolution at later stages of neural processing.
	Our improved estimates for the density of central ganglion cells
	allowed us to ask whether there are enough ganglion cells for each

	calculations indicate that 1) there are so many ganglion cells relative

	require fibers of Henle radiating toward rather than away from the
	foveal center; and 2) like the macaque, the human retina may have
	enough ganglion cells to transmit the information afforded by closely

  abstract = {PURPOSE. The basic assumption of fundus reflection densitometry is
	that changes in reflectance are
	
	solely determined by photolysis and regenerating visual pigments.
	This study was undertaken to
	
	investigate small but systematic deviations from this rule.
	
	METHODS. Spectral reflectance changes (450 –740 nm) of the fovea were
	measured during light and
	
	dark adaptation over a period of 66 minutes in five healthy subjects.
	The directional properties of
	
	the fundus reflection were examined with a custom-built scanning laser
	ophthalmoscope (SLO) at
	
	514, 633, and 790 nm. The same instrument was also used to find the
	spatial distribution of the
	
	reflectance changes.
	
	RESULTS. In addition to fast changes consistent with visual pigment,
	slower reflectance changes
	
	(lasting 10 –20 minutes) were observed at all wavelengths including
	740 nm. Because visual
	
	pigment does not absorb at 740 nm, a second mechanism must be involved.
	Factor analysis
	
	generated two factors (i.e., spectral curves) that explained more
	than 97\% of the variations in
	
	the time course of the spectral reflectance. Total reflectance was
	modeled by means of an
	
	existing model for fundus reflection, and it was found that the first
	factor strongly resembled
	
	the rapid changes in absorption of the cone pigments. The second factor
	seems linked to slow
	
	changes in cone reflectance. Measurements with the SLO showed a clear
	increase in direction-
	
	ally dependent reflectance from 6 to 30 minutes in the dark. This
	was observed only in the
	
	central 6° of the retina.
	
	CONCLUSIONS. The characteristics of the slow reflectance changes all
	point to the cone photorecep-
	
	tors as the origin. Most likely, alterations in the index of refraction
	between the interphotoreceptor
	
	matrix and photoreceptors lie at the base of this hitherto unknown
	phenomenon. (Invest Oph-

  abstract = {Purpose:Models of fundus reflectance predict that the ratio of the
	light reflected from the choroid to that from the receptors increases
	with wavelength, for example by a factor of 6 from 550 nm to 750
	nm (Van der Kraats et al., 1996). The light returning from layers
	behind the receptors is assumed to couple inefficiently back into
	the receptors. This assumption is supported by experiments that show
	that autofluorescence from lipofuscin in the RPE is not subject to
	photoreceptor waveguide effects visualized in the pupil (Prieto et
	al. OSA, 2000). These results predict that the contrast of the photoreceptor
	mosaic imaged in vivo with adaptive optics should dramatically decrease
	with increasing wavelength, by about a factor of 6 from 550 to 750
	nm. We tested this prediction by imaging the cone mosaic with the
	Rochester Adaptive Optics Ophthalmoscope.
	
	
	Methods: We imaged bleached photoreceptors at 10 in the temporal retina
	in two young human subjects at 550, 650, and 750 nm. To keep image
	noise constant, the amount of reflected light captured by the imaging
	camera was equalized for all wavelengths. The sharpest seven images
	for each wavelength were then registered and summed to increase signal
	to noise. The contrast of the cone mosaic was inferred from the power
	spectrum of these registered images.
	
	
	Results:In both subjects, there is a slight tendency for the contrast
	of images of the cone mosaic to decline with wavelength, but it is
	surprisingly small. The magnitude of the power spectrum at the cone
	sampling frequency decreased by less than a factor of 2 for one subject
	and 1.4 for the other from 550 nm to 750 nm, corresponding to a reduction
	in contrast of 1.4 and 1.2 respectively.
	
	
	Conclusions:The weak dependence of the contrast of our cone images
	on wavelength is inconsistent with models of fundus reflectance in
	which the light returning from layers behind the retina is not coupled
	efficiently into cones. The high contrast of cone images in infrared
	light implies that the light scattered back from deep retinal layers
	must predominantly return through the cone photoreceptors and not
	through the spaces between cones.

  abstract = {An imaging modality that allows for fast, simultaneous, noninvasive
	probing of both three-dimensional (3D) cellular resolution retinal
	morphology and depth-resolved function could substantially improve
	the early diagnosis of various retinal diseases that are the leading
	causes of blindness worldwide and could contribute to a better understanding
	of retinal pathogenesis and enhanced therapy monitoring. In addition
	to user friendliness, reliability, and cost, the key technological
	parameters of any imaging technique that can markedly influence its
	clinical feasibility are axial (depth) and transverse image resolution,
	measurement time, detection sensitivity, penetration depth in tissue,
	and image contrast. Advances in photonics technology, including the
	development of ultrabroad bandwidth and high-speed tuneable light
	sources and high-speed detection techniques, have enabled a considerable
	improvement in the visualization capability of optical coherence
	tomography ({OCT}) in the past decade, establishing it as a state-of-the-art,
	noninvasive, complementary ophthalmic diagnostic methodology. Axial
	image resolution has been a key parameter for ophthalmic imaging
	because of the stratified organization of the retina. In contrast
	to standard or confocal microscopy, axial and transverse OCT resolution
	are decoupled, with the axial being mainly determined by the optical
	bandwidth of the used light source and the transverse by the focusing
	quality of the measurement beam onto the imaged tissue. In this sense,
	OCT bridges the gap between the high resolution and limited penetration
	of confocal microscopy and the low resolution and high penetration
	of ultrasound. These properties make OCT a unique ophthalmic diagnostic
	modality, in which high axial resolution, despite a long depth of
	focus (field)—a situation encountered in retinal imaging in vivo
	—can be accomplished. Furthermore, the ocular media are essentially
	transparent, transmitting light with minimal optical attenuation
	and scattering, to provide easy optical access to the retina. As
	a consequence, there have been numerous recent developments in OCT
	technology and considerable interest in this topic, especially in
	the field of ophthalmology. Objectively, this interest is evidenced
	by the great increase in publications, patents, and companies involved
	in the field of OCT in recent years. The market for OCT equipment
	is predicted to grow at a compound annual rate of more than 30\%
	in the next 4 years, reaching Formula 200 million by 2011.1 It is
	noteworthy that approximately 50\% of all OCT publications so far
	have been in ophthalmology journals, demonstrating the major impact
	of this technique in this field. Another 25\% have been published
	in optical journals, reflecting the numerous technical advances that
	have been accomplished.},

	The development of broadband light sources emitting at new wavelengths,

	tomography (OCT) technology with unprecedented axial resolution for
	enhanced imaging of intraretinal microstructures and to investigate
	its clinical feasibility to visualize intraretinal morphology of

	Methods A clinically viable ultrahigh-resolution ophthalmic OCT system
	was developed and used in clinical imaging for the first time. Fifty-six
	eyes of 40 selected patients with different macular diseases including
	macular hole, macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, central

	Outcome Measures Ultrahigh-resolution tomograms visualizing intraretinal
	morphologic features in different retinal diseases.
	
	
	Results An axial image resolution of approximately 3 µm was achieved
	in the eyes examined, nearly 2 orders of magnitude better than conventional
	ophthalmic ultrasound. Ultrahigh-resolution OCT images provided additional
	diagnostically important information on intraretinal morphologic
	features that could not have been obtained by standard techniques.
	
	
	Conclusions Ultrahigh-resolution ophthalmic OCT enables unprecedented
	visualization of intraretinal morphologic features and therefore
	has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of ocular
	pathogenesis, as well as to enhance the sensitivity and specificity
	for early ophthalmic diagnosis and to monitor the efficacy of therapy.
	This study establishes a baseline for the interpretation of ultrahigh-resolution

	responses to visual stimuli noninvasively, by using functional magnetic
	resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: fMRI was performed on a 9.4-Tesla
	scanner to map activity-evoked signal changes of the retina-choroid
	complex associated with visual stimulation in anesthetized cats (n
	= 6). Three to 12 1-mm slices were acquired in a single shot using
	inversion-recovery, echo-planar imaging with a nominal in-plane resolution
	of 468 x 468 microm(2). Visual stimuli were presented to the full
	visual field and to the upper and lower visual fields. The stimuli
	were drifting or stationary gratings, which were compared with the
	dark condition. Activation maps were computed using cross-correlation
	analysis and overlaid on anatomic images. Multislice activation maps
	were reconstructed and flattened onto a two-dimensional surface.
	RESULTS: fMRI activation maps showed robust increased activity in
	the retina-choroid complex after visual stimulation. The average
	stimulus-evoked fMRI signal increase associated with drifting-grating
	stimulus was 1.7\% +/- 0.5\% (P < 10(-4), n = 6) compared with dark.
	Multislice functional images of the retina flattened onto a two-dimensional
	surface showed relatively uniform activation. No statistically significant
	activation was observed in and around the optic nerve head. Hemifield
	stimulation studies demonstrated that stimuli presented to the upper
	half of the visual field activated the lower part of the retina,
	and stimuli presented to the lower half of the visual field activated
	the upper part of the retina, as expected. Signal changes evoked
	by the stationary gratings compared with the dark basal condition
	were positive but were approximately half that evoked by the drifting
	gratings (1.0\% +/- 0.1\% versus 2.1\% +/- 0.3\%, P < 10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS:
	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study of the
	retina, demonstrating its feasibility in imaging retinal function
	dynamically in a noninvasive manner and at relatively high spatial

	cones, which respond preferentially to long-, middle- and short-wavelength
	visible light, respectively. Colour appearance results from neural
	processing of these cone signals within the retina and the brain.
	Perceptual experiments have identified three types of neural pathways
	that represent colour: a red-green pathway that signals differences
	between L- and M-cone responses; a blue-yellow pathway that signals
	differences between S-cone responses and a sum of L- and M-cone responses;
	and a luminance pathway that signals a sum of L- and M-cone responses.
	It might be expected that there are neurons in the primary visual
	cortex with response properties that resemble these three perceptual
	pathways, but attempts to find them have led to inconsistent results.
	We have therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
	to examine responses in the human brain to a large number of colours.
	In visual cortical areas V1 and V2, the strongest response is to
	red-green stimuli, and much of this activity is from neurons receiving
	opposing inputs from L and M cones. A strong response is also seen
	with blue-yellow stimuli, and this response declines rapidly as the
	temporal frequency of the stimulus is increased. These responses
	resemble psychophysical measurements, suggesting that colour signals
	relevant for perception are encoded in a large population of neurons

	Receptor dimers have been proposed as the functional unit responsible
	for catalytic interaction with G{alpha}beta{gamma}. To investigate
	whether a G protein-coupled receptor monomer can activate G{alpha}beta{gamma},
	we used the retinal photoreceptor rhodopsin and its cognate G protein
	transducin (Gt) to determine the stoichiometry of rhodopsin/Gt binding
	and the rate of catalyzed nucleotide exchange in Gt. Purified rhodopsin
	was prepared in dodecyl maltoside detergent solution. Rhodopsin was
	monomeric as concluded from fluorescence resonance energy transfer,
	copurification studies with fluorescent labeled and unlabeled rhodopsin,
	size exclusion chromatography, and multiangle laser light scattering.
	A 1:1 complex between light-activated rhodopsin and Gt was found
	in the elution profiles, and one molecule of GDP was released upon
	complex formation. Analysis of the speed of catalytic rhodopsin/Gt
	interaction yielded a maximum of {approx}50 Gt molecules per second
	and molecule of activated rhodopsin. The bimolecular rate constant
	is close to the diffusion limit in the diluted system. The results
	show that the interaction of Gt with an activated rhodopsin monomer
	is sufficient for fully functional Gt activation. Although the activation
	rate in solution is at the physically possible limit, the rate in
	the native membrane is still 10-fold higher. This is likely attributable
	to the precise orientation of the G protein to the membrane surface,
	which enables a fast docking process preceding the actual activation
	step. Whether docking in membranes involves the formation of rhodopsin
	dimers or oligomers remains to be elucidated.},

	With the head still, in either of these directions the mean standard
	deviation of gaze position (inclusive saccades) was about 7 min arc;
	mean non-saccadic retinal image speeds were 20-30 min arc/sec. During
	head oscillation these values increased to about 16 min arc and 1
	deg/sec; a mean of about 2.5% of the head motion remained uncorrected

	our earlier results for the horizontal plane; the effect of the corrections
	was relatively small because the adventitious cross-coupling of horizontal
	and vertical to torsional head movements proved to be usually smaller
	than 10%. However, the corrections were important when head torsion
	was deliberately produced. Gaze stability in the torsional plane
	was considerably inferior to that in the horizontal and vertical

	that in cross section the structure of axons of all diameters from
	these nerves is exudes from all of them after section (11). Con-
	similar and that axoplasm cerning the giant axons, he reported that
	the axoplasm could be moved freely within them (there being no transverse
	septa in squid giant axons comparable to those described by Stough
	(10) in the giant axons of Lumbri- cus) and that it flowed from them
	after section at varying rates. He observed that “under the highest
	powers of the microscope the axon appears as a homogeneous cylinder
	having no central core or definite neurofibrils which can be traced
	separately. There is, however, a very delicate longitudinal striation
	extending throughout the thickness of the fibre. The striae are very
	fine and exceedingly numerous.” He also described the formation of
	coarser fibrils extending back into the axoplasm from points where
	the axon had been punctured, and stated that since these “coarser
	striations appear after damage to an axon, it is difficult to be
	certain whether this faint fibrillation be not also an artifact.”
	In describing fixed preparations Young wrote, “The faint longitudinal
	striations appeared after all the histological methods used. . .
	The appearance varied somewhat according to the fixation, the striation
	. bemg somewhat coarser after fixation in formaldehyde. . . . In
	some preparations, however, there appeared central cores with a different
	staining reaction and a more fibrillar appearance than the rest of
	the axon” (13). Be- cause of the variability in size of the striae
	and fibrils which he described, Young evidently leaned toward the
	belief that all of them were artifacts. In their description of the
	squid giant axons which they used for electric impedance measurements
	Cole and Curtis (7) stated, “The fibers (giant axons) which remained
	in good condition for considerable time were usually very turgid
	after dissection.” An increase in turgor under mechanical stimu-
	lation was also reported by Young in a study of the regeneration
	of cut mammalian neurons (14). To confirm these reports of axoplasm
	extrusion after section and turgidity increase under stimulation
	and to investigate the more than 50 stellate nerves and giant biochemical
	mechanisms involved, axons were dissected from Loligo.},

  abstract = {We recorded the electroretinogram (ERG) from human subjects with normal
	vision, using ganzfeld stimulation in the presence of rod-suppressing
	blue background light. In families of responses to flashes of increasing
	intensity, we investigated features of both receptoral and post-receptoral
	origin. Firstly, we found that the oscillatory potentials (OPs, that
	have long been known to be post-receptoral) exhibited a time course
	that was invariant over a range of bright flash intensities. Secondly,
	we found that the photopic b-wave (which probably originates in cone
	ON bipolar cells) was most pronounced after test flashes of around
	20 Td s, and could be suppressed either by increasing the test flash
	intensity or by applying a second flash after the test flash. We
	obtained estimates of the time course of the cone photoreceptor response
	using the paired-flash technique, in which an intense ‘probe' flash
	was delivered at different times after a test flash. The response
	to the probe flash was recorded and, its amplitude was measured at
	early times after the probe flash. Estimates obtained in this way
	were of normalized amplitude, but could be scaled to an absolute
	amplitude by making an assumption about the level of probe-flash
	response that corresponded to complete suppression of photoreceptor
	current. For moderately bright test flashes the estimated cone photoreceptor
	response at early times coincided closely with the a-wave of the
	test flash ERG. However, the maximal size of this estimated response
	accounted for only about 70\% of the peak a-wave amplitude in the
	case of bright flashes, and for an even smaller proportion after
	flashes of lower intensity, and we take this to indicate the existence
	of a third substantial post-receptoral contribution to the a-wave.
	For dim flashes, the time-to-peak of the cone response was around
	15–20 ms, and for saturating flashes the dominant time constant of
	recovery was about 18 ms. The intensity dependence of the estimated
	cone response amplitude at fixed times followed an exponential saturation
	relation. We provide a comparison between our estimates of photoreceptor
	responses from human cones, and recent estimates from monkey cones
	obtained using related ERG approaches, and earlier single-cell measurements
	from isolated primate cones.},

	retina with 840 nm infrared light. Modulation of each laser beam
	using acousto-optic modulators allowed the integration of complex,
	patterned stimuli into the projected raster, whose exact locations
	on the retina were recorded into the movie in real time. Stimulus
	luminance was 12,000 cd/m2. Twenty- to 30-second movies were recorded,
	with stimulation occurring at 5 seconds. Intensity changes in the
	infrared image in response to the visible stimulus were monitored
	over time.
	
	RESULTS. In five subjects, results showed a clear increase in infrared
	light scattering in the stimulated region with respect to its surroundings,
	reproduced in four subjects across multiple imaging sessions. Signal
	increase began immediately at the onset of the stimulus, reached
	a peak 2 to 3 seconds after stimulus onset, and decreased to baseline
	within 2 to 10 seconds. The magnitude of the increase over the stimulated
	area varied from 0\% to 5\% between subjects.
	
	CONCLUSIONS. Results suggested that the signal originated in the cone
	photoreceptors, though not all cones contributed to the same extent.
	In individual cones, signal increases over 20\% were measured. Excessive
	eye movements and dim images gave insufficient signal to noise. Eight
	subjects showed spurious results for these reasons and were eliminated
	from the study.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. Photoreceptor outer segments are in a dynamic state of membrane
	addition and disposal. This study was undertaken to determine how
	a standardized period of retinal detachment and varying periods of
	reattachment affect the renewal process. METHODS. To investigate
	the effects that retinal detachment and reattachment may have on
	this process, the neural retina from 12 adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca
	mulatta) was detached from the overlying retinal pigment epithelium
	(RPE) by subretinal injection of a balanced salt solution. After
	a standardized detachment period of 7 days, the two tissue layers
	were reapposed. Animals were labeled with 3H-fucose and killed at
	times ranging from 3-150 days after reattachment. RESULTS. During
	the 7 day detachment period, the majority of rod outer segments (ROS)
	and cone outer segments (COS) degenerated, but inner segments remained
	intact. During the first week after reattachment, a rapid increase
	in rod and cone outer segment length occurred in the absence of disc
	shedding. This was accompanied by re-establishment of a modified
	morphologic relationship between the apical processes of the RPE
	and the regenerating outer segments. ROS and COS regained approximately
	40% of their control lengths after a 2 wk reattachment period. By
	30 days of reattachment, ROS had regained 72% of their normal length
	and COS had regained approximately 48%. After 150 days of reattachment,
	photoreceptor outer segment mean length was not statistically different
	from control areas. Autoradiographic results confirmed that new disc
	membranes were synthesized after reattachment. The rate of ROS membrane
	assembly was subnormal at reattachment time points up to 30 days.
	CONCLUSIONS. Retinal detachment leads to a reduction in photoreceptor
	outer segment absolute length and membrane assembly rates. Increasing
	time of retinal reattachment is positively correlated with an increase
	in outer segment absolute length and a corresponding increase in
	membrane assembly rates. This recovery pattern in eyes without underlying
	pathology and after a relatively brief detachment interval may represent
	the upper limit of the recovery process.},

	Intrinsic Signal Imaging in Macaque Retina}},
  journal = IOVS,
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Purpose: Intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) detects light-induced micro-structural
	or metabolic changes in retinal tissues. Thus, activities of the
	rod and cone systems could be mapped topographically. However, there
	is no direct evidence on the cellular origin of the signals. The
	purpose of this study was to determine if and how the retinal ganglion
	cells (RGCs) contribute to the ISI. Methods: In anesthetized macaque
	monkeys, the properties of intrinsic signals were investigated by
	1) simultaneous measurement of the retina and the primary visual
	cortex (V1) with different wavelengths of observation light; 2) measurement
	of the flash-induced blood flow changes by laser Doppler flowmetry,
	and 3) intravitreal injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX). Results: Slow
	components of the ISI well correspond to the flash-induced blood
	flow increase. The intrinsic signals of the posterior retina are
	partially decreased and the signal of the optic disc is completely
	abolished by an intravitreal injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX) at a
	concentration that should reduce the neural activities of RGCs. The
	intrinsic signal at the fovea did not change significantly following
	the TTX injection. Conclusions: Not only the photoreceptors in the
	outer retina but the RGCs in the inner retina are major contributors
	to the intrinsic signals, and that the activity of the RGCs can be
	mapped by using both the fast and slow components of the signal in
	the posterior retina. The functional organization of the RGC layer
	has not been objectively mapped, and our results indicate that the
	ISI has the potential to do this.},

  abstract = {Cone photoreceptors are less sensitive to light and the duration of
	their photoresponse is shorter than that of rods. In salamander rods
	and cones, we identified 3 components in membrane currents activated
	by bright flashes of light: an early receptor current (ERC) resulting
	from charge displacement within visual pigments, a saturation photocurrent
	generated by the closure of the cGMP-sensitive channels, and a putative
	Na-Ca exchanger current. The time courses of both the ERC and the
	onset of the saturation photocurrent were similar in rods and cones.
	The putative Na-Ca exchanger current, on the other hand, is 4- to
	8-fold faster in cones. The onset of the saturation photocurrent
	consisted of a delay followed by a fast relaxation with an exponential
	time course. In both photoreceptor types the delay and the time course
	of the fast relaxation are dependent on light intensity and reach
	a limiting value when about 1\% of the photopigment is bleached.
	The limiting value of the delay, about 8 msec, and of the relaxation
	time constant, about 2 msec, are nearly identical in rods and cones.
	The near identity of these parameters implies that at least 2 kinetic
	steps in the activation response of rods and cones are quantitatively
	similar. These findings suggest that the functional differences between
	rods and cones may arise from disparities in the processes that restore
	the components of the phototransduction cascade to their dark level
	and not from differences in the activation processes.},

  abstract = {It has been shown (Hill & Keynes, 1949) that there is a change in
	the opacity of a crustacean nerve trunk when it is stimulated at
	high frequency for several seconds. The cause of this phenomenon
	was at first obscure, but further experi- ments (Hill, 1950) have
	suggested that it is due to a change in volume of the fibres. From
	the facts which have beeninferred about ionic transfer and exchange
	in the active nerve fibre (Hodgkin & HuTxley, 1947; Hodgkin & Katz,
	1949; Keynes, 1950), stimulation would be expected to result in an
	extremely small increase in fibre volume. On this basis it was argued
	by Hill (1950) that 500 impulses might be expected to cause the diameter
	of individual fibres of a crustacean nerve to increase by 0 0009-0
	009,u., and there was evidence that a change of this order of magnitude
	could give rise to the observed change in opacity. However, the conclusion
	was not founded on any direct proof that such a change actually takes
	place, for there are other possible cau'ses of a change in opacity.
	The single fibre preparation of the cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis)
	offered a means of testing the hypothesis, and this paper describes
	how it has been possible to record changes in diameter of this giant
	fibre when it is stimulated. In certain circumstances the fibres
	of a nerve trunk appear to shrink before swelling (Hill, 1950). It
	will be seen that an initial shrinkage takes place also in the single

	comparable to the metarhodopsin II absorption change, probably arising
	from a structural change within the disc membrane.
	
	Ni: A slow signal, disappearing with the first flash, which may be

  number = {5},
  abstract = {With the multifocal technique, as developed by Erich Sutter and colleagues,
	scores of focal electroretinogram (ERG) responses can be obtained
	in a matter of minutes. Although this technique is relatively new,
	it has already provided insights into the mechanisms of retinal disease.
	However, because it is new, there also remain questions about how
	it works and what it measures. This chapter considers some of these
	insights and some of these questions. The first part (Section 2)
	describes how the multifocal ERG (mERG) is recorded and considers
	its relationship to the full-field ERG. The mERG responses are shown
	to be from relatively local regions of the retina and are comprised
	of the same components as the full-field ERG. The diagnostic advantage
	of the mERG as compared to the full-field ERG is also illustrated.
	In Section 3, the effects of damage to different cell layers of the
	retina are shown to affect the mERG differently, and these changes
	are summarized within a conceptual framework. It is argued, for example,
	that when diseases of the receptor outer segment, like retinitis
	pigmentosa, result in small, depressed mERG responses, then the damage
	is, as expected, at the outer segment. However, when these diseases
	result in mERG responses that are reasonably large but very delayed,
	then the damage is beyond the outer segment, probably in the outer
	plexiform layer. The implicit time of the mERG, not amplitude, is
	the more sensitive measure of damage in degenerative diseases of
	the receptors. On the other hand, diseases, like glaucoma, which
	act on the ganglion axon, do not result in easily identified changes
	to the mERG unless inner retinal damage is involved as well. Inner
	retinal damage changes the waveform of the mERG and decreases the
	naso-temporal variation normally observed. Finally, diseases, like
	diabetes, that act on more than one layer of the retina can have
	a range of effects. In Section 4, recent work with the monkey mERG
	is reviewed, with emphasis on the relevance to human diseases. For
	example, blocking the sodium-based action potentials produced by
	ganglion and amacrine cells eliminates the naso-temporal variation
	in the monkey mERG and these altered mERG responses resemble those
	from some patients with diabetes or glaucoma. Finally, in Section
	5 the second-order kernel is described. The presence of a second-order
	kernel has important implications for understanding the shape of
	the mERG response (first-order kernel). Full-field simulations of
	the mERG paradigm illustrate that the first-order kernel is comprised
	of responses with different waveforms. Further, it is argued that
	the nonlinear, adaptive mechanisms that produce the second-order
	kernel are involved in shaping the time course of the response. Patients
	with large, but abnormally delayed mERG responses (first-order kernel),
	do not have a detectable second-order kernel. It is speculated that
	a markedly diminished second-order kernel is diagnostic of outer
	plexiform layer damage, not inner plexiform layer damage as is commonly
	assumed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. To better understand the cellular contributions to the human
	multifocal ERG (mfERG), rhesus monkey and human mfERGs were recorded
	using the same stimulus conditions. The monkey mfERGs were recorded
	before and after injections of pharmacologic agents known to selectively
	block activity of particular cells and circuits in the retina.
	
	METHODS. Photopic mfERGs were recorded with Dawson-Trick-Litzkow (DTL)
	fiber electrodes from 16 eyes of 10 anesthetized adult rhesus monkeys
	(Macaca mulatta) and from 4 normal humans. The display consisted
	of 103 equal-sized hexagons within 17° of the fovea. Monkey mfERGs
	were obtained before and after inner retinal responses were suppressed
	with intravitreal injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX), TTX+N-methyl-D-aspartic
	acid (NMDA), TTX+NMDA with the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABAA&C)
	antagonist picrotoxin (PTX), or the inhibitory amino acid GABA and
	after L-2 amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB) to block signal transmission
	to ON-bipolar cells. Finally, a combination of APB and cis-2,3 piperidine
	dicarboxylic acid (PDA) was used to isolate the contributions from
	the cone photoreceptors.
	
	RESULTS. TTX, which blocks sodium-based action potentials, removes
	a large contribution from the monkey's mfERG, but it does not remove
	all inner retinal influences. After administration of TTX, the mfERG
	is further modified by the addition of NMDA. TTX+NMDA, TTX+NMDA+PTX,
	or GABA alone have similar effects, suggesting that, at the concentrations
	used, they are largely removing the inner retinal contributions.
	After removing the inner retinal influences, the monkey's mfERG is
	mainly composed of ON- and OFF-bipolar contributions, as revealed
	after APB and PDA were injected. The leading edge of the first negative
	potential (N1) is largely shaped by the initial hyperpolarization
	of the OFF-bipolar cells. The photoreceptors also contribute to the
	leading edge of N1, but this contribution is small, except in the
	central 6°. The depolarization of the ON-bipolars and the recovery
	of the OFF-bipolars contribute to the leading edge of the major positive
	component (P1), with the recovery of the ON-bipolars being the dominant
	influence on the trailing edge. The waveform of the human mfERG most
	closely resembles the rhesus monkey's mfERG after administration
	of TTX.
	
	CONCLUSIONS. The monkey's mfERG is shaped by large contributions from
	ON- and OFF-bipolar cells, combined with both spiking and nonspiking
	inner retinal contributions, and a small contribution from the photoreceptors.
	In comparison, the human mfERG resembles the monkey's mfERG after
	reduction of inner retinal contributions. Based on the pharmacologic
	dissection of the monkey's mfERG, a model of the waveform of the
	human mfERG is proposed. This model suggests that the waveform can
	be understood as a combination of overlapping ON- and OFF-bipolar
	cell contributions combined with smaller contributions from inner
	retina and photoreceptors.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. The distribution of the electrical current over the retina
	when electrical pulses are delivered transsclerally has not been
	clearly determined objectively and quantitatively in humans. The
	purpose of this study was to determine the pattern of electrically
	evoked neural activity in the monkey retina by using intrinsic signal
	imaging.
	
	METHODS. The intrinsic signals of monkey retinas were recorded as
	changes in the reflectance of infrared light from the retina after
	transscleral electrical stimulation by DTL electrodes. The effects
	of changing the stimulus parameters (e.g., intensity, duration, and
	frequency) of the electrical current, were investigated.
	
	RESULTS. Electrical stimulation evoked a uniform change in the reflectivity
	across the posterior pole of the retina; that is, the intrinsic signals
	changed uniformly. A peak of the intrinsic signal was not observed
	at the fovea. The threshold of the intrinsic signal was not significantly
	different for the macula, perimacula, and optic disc, and the threshold
	did not differ under dark- and light-adapted conditions. The strength
	of the signals increased with longer stimulus durations, and the
	maximum signals were obtained when the stimulus frequency was between
	15 and 20 Hz.
	
	CONCLUSIONS. Intrinsic signals of the monkey retina evoked by transscleral
	electrical stimulation are elicited uniformly across the posterior
	pole of the fundus and most likely arise from activation of the inner
	or middle layers of the retina. These functional measurements could
	serve as a diagnostic tool for mapping the inner retinal activity,
	by which the site of a lesion can be noninvasively imaged.},

	studies have indicated an origin of bleaching desensitization in
	the visual pigment itself, but have not identified the mechanism
	of action. A candidate for the site at which densensitization is
	initially expressed is the activation of transducin (formation of
	T*) on the rod disk membranes; this reaction directly involves rhodopsin
	in its photoactivated (R*) form and mediates initial amplification
	of the visual signal (reviewed in refs 7–9). We have analysed the
	effect of bleaching on the sensitivity of a flash-induced light-scattering
	signal known to monitor the disk-based amplifier10–12, and which
	has been established as specifically monitoring transducin activation13.
	We have recorded this signal from functioning retinal rods in situ
	('ATR' signal)14 and find that bleaches inducing a pronounced, sustained
	loss in rod electro-physiological sensitivity do not alter the sensitivity
	of the ATR response after correction for reduced quantum catch. Our
	results indicate that the biochemical gain of the R*right arrowT*
	transduction stage remains unchanged in the presence of bleached
	pigment and implicate a subsequent reaction as the first to show
	a sustained, bleaching-dependent gain reduction.},

	with a time resolution better than 1 s, and to discriminate between
	products with similar absorbance spectra that differ with respect
	to the orientation of their chromophore in the photoreceptor membrane.
	We demonstrate that metarhodopsin III is in a pH-reversible equilibrium
	with metarhodopsin II and that the metarhodopsin III chromophore
	is orientated with respect to the membrane plane even more strictly
	than the 11-cis retinal in “dark” rhodopsin. This indicates that
	all-trans retinal in metarhodopsin III is still attached to its native
	binding site on opsin. The kinetic scheme of the decay of metarhodopsins
	is presented in which metarhodopsin III lies in a shunt pathway from
	metarhodopsin II to retinal. Formation of metarhodopsin III was detected
	at bleaches as low as [approximate] 3\%, contrary to previous reports
	that it is not formed at below 10\% bleaches. Another product that
	is spectrally similar to metarhodopsin III, termed P440, appears
	at later stages of photolysis as the result of the decay of metarhodopsin
	II and metarhodopsin III. The chromophoric group in P440 is orientated
	preferentially across the disk membrane. The final product(s) in
	isolated ROS, where the reduction of retinal to retinol is blocked,
	consists of a mixture of a free retinal and retinal possibly attached
	to different binding sites in the membrane. In metabolically active
	rods the later products are quickly converted to retinol. We conclude
	that metarhodopsin III represents a specific conformational state
	of metarhodopsin where the chromophoric binding site is still occupied
	by all-trans retinal. Hence, the formation and decay of metarhodopsin
	III may be limiting for the rate of rhodopsin regeneration and photoreceptor
	dark adaptation.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. To study how the photoreceptoral and postreceptoral ON- and
	OFF-components contribute to the photopic sine-wave flicker ERG in
	the monkey by isolating the components with glutamate analogs.
	
	METHODS. Monkey photopic flicker ERGs were elicited with sine wave
	stimuli (mean luminance, 2.66 log cd/m2; 80% modulation depth, on
	a 40 cd/m2 white background) and were recorded for stimulus frequencies
	of 4 Hz to 64 Hz, before and after intravitreal injection of DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric
	acid (APB) and cis-2,3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid (PDA) that block
	ON- and OFF-bipolar activity, respectively. The amplitude and phase
	of the fundamental component were analyzed.
	
	RESULTS. The flicker response amplitudes increased after APB, for
	frequencies of 6 Hz to 32 Hz. The further addition of PDA to isolate
	the photoreceptor component resulted in a relatively small residual
	response that decreased monotonically from 4 Hz to 32 Hz. The postsynaptic
	APB (ON-) and PDA (OFF-) sensitive components were isolated by subtraction
	and were characterized by amplitude and phase vectors. The ON- and
	OFF-components were larger than the initial control responses for
	stimuli of 8 Hz to 40 Hz. These two components had a frequency-dependent
	phase difference of 160° to 230°; normally, they interfere with each
	other and reduce their net contribution. The phase difference between
	ON- and OFF-components was nearly 180° for a 10-Hz stimulus, and
	the phase cancellation caused a prominent dip in amplitude at this
	frequency.
	
	CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that postreceptoral ON- and OFF-components
	contribute substantially to the sine-wave flicker ERG, especially
	at higher stimulus frequencies. Because of phase cancellation, they
	mask each other in the net response in a frequency dependent fashion.
	The photoreceptor contribution is greater than the net postsynaptic
	component only for frequencies of approximately less than or equal
	to 10 Hz. These results can be summarized by a vector model that
	may be useful for interpreting changes resulting from retinal disease.},

	Three regions of rhodopsin's cytoplasmic surface interact with the
	rod cell G protein transducin (Gt). These are (i) the second cytoplasmic
	loop, which connects rhodopsin helices III and IV, (ii) the third
	cytoplasmic loop, which connects rhodopsin helices V and VI, and
	(iii) a putative fourth cytoplasmic loop formed by amino acids 310-321,
	as the carboxyl-terminal sequence emerges from helix VII and anchors
	to the lipid bilayer via palmitoylcysteines 322 and 323. Evidence
	for these regions of interaction of rhodopsin and Gt comes from the
	ability of synthetic peptides comprising these regions to compete
	with metarhodopsin II for binding to Gt. A spectroscopic assay that
	measures the "extra MII" caused by Gt binding was used to measure
	the extent of binding of Gt in the presence of competing peptides.
	The three peptides corresponding to the second, third, and fourth

	all remaining surface regions of rhodopsin failed to compete even

	model of Marcos et al. [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 15, 2012 (1998)] predicts
	that the shape of this intensity distribution is determined by both
	the waveguide properties of the cone photoreceptors and the topography
	of the cone mosaic (cone spacing). We have performed two types of
	cone directionality measurement. In the first type, cone directionality
	estimates are obtained by measuring the spatial distribution of light
	returning from the retina with a single-entry pupil position (single-entry
	measurements). In the second type, estimates are obtained by measuring
	the total amount of light guided back through the pupil as a function
	of entry pupil position (multiple-entry measurements). As predicted
	by the model, single-entry measurements provide narrower distributions
	than the multiple-entry measurements, since the former are affected
	by both waveguides and scattering and the latter are affected primarily
	by waveguides. Measurements at different retinal eccentricities and
	at two different wavelengths are consistent with the model. We show
	that the broader multiple-entry measurements are not accounted for
	by cone disarray. Results of multiple-entry measurements are closer
	to results from measurements of the psychophysical Stiles–Crawford
	effect (although still narrower), and the variation with retinal
	eccentricity and wavelength is similar. By combining single- and
	multiple-entry measurements, we can estimate cone spacing. The estimates

	a conclusion that was confirmed with estimates of the optical quality
	of these eyes obtained with a Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor. These
	results emphasize the superiority of the eye's optics over the spatial
	sampling limits of the retina when the eye's optical quality is optimized.

  volume = {44},
  pages = {4580 - 4592},
  abstract = {PURPOSE. Individual cones were imaged in the living human eye with
	the Rochester adaptive optics ophthalmoscope. In all eyes, there
	were large differences in the reflectance of different cones, even
	when all the photopigment was bleached. To help understand what produces
	this spatial variation, the investigators explored whether it is
	a static or a dynamic property of the cone mosaic.
	
	
	METHODS. Fully bleached cone images were acquired in three eyes with
	an adaptive optics system. Images were collected over a 10-minute
	period approximately every hour for 24 hours. The temporal variation
	in cone directionality was measured in one eye. Finally, the experimental
	data on the temporal variation of absorption were compared with findings
	in various models of reflectance.
	
	
	RESULTS. Cone reflectance changes over time appear to be independent
	from cone to cone. These temporal changes are present in all three
	cone classes. The spatiotemporal variation in cone reflectance is
	not caused by the spatiotemporal variation in the optical axes of
	cones. This, along with the modeling results, suggest that changes
	in the reflectance affect the light that passes through photopigment
	in the receptors rather than the stray light, and that the changes
	are related to the outer segment-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
	interface.
	
	
	CONCLUSIONS. The reflectance of individual cones is a dynamic property
	of the mosaic. Changes can be observed over periods of minutes as
	well as many hours. The cause of the variation is not known but may
	be related to the process of disc shedding in receptors.},

  pages = {469-482},
  abstract = {1. We recorded the a-wave of the electroretinogram from human subjects
	with normal vision, using a corneal fibre electrode and ganzfeld
	stimulation under photopic conditions, so as to extract the parameters
	of cone phototransduction. The amplitude of bright flash responses
	provided a measure of the massed circulating current of the cones,
	while the amplitude of dim flash responses provided a measure of
	the product of the fraction of cone photopigment present, and the
	amplification constant of transduction within the cones.
	
	
	 2. In the presence of steady background illumination, the cone circulating
	current declined to half at 3000 photopic trolands, and to a quarter
	at 20 000 photopic trolands.
	
	
	 3. At very early times after the delivery of a near-total bleach,
	we could not determine the level of circulating current as our bright
	flashes did not appear to saturate the a-wave (presumably because
	so little pigment was present). However, by 20-30 s after a total
	bleach, the cone circulating current had returned to its dark-adapted
	level.
	
	
	 4. Following smaller bleaches (when ca 50 \% of the pigment remained
	present) the bright flashes were able to saturate the a-wave even
	at very early times. Within 3 s of extinction of the illumination,
	the cone circulating current had returned to its dark-adapted level.
	
	
	 5. This is at least a factor of 300 times faster than the period
	of ca 15 min required for full recovery of rods exposed to the same
	level of bleach, and indicates a major difference between rods and
	cones in the way that they cope with the photoproducts of bleaching.
	
	
	 6. Despite the very rapid recovery of circulating current after bleaches,
	the recovery of dim-flash sensitivity was much slower, with a time
	constant of ca 1·5 min after a near-total bleach. This time course
	is very similar to previous measurements of the regeneration of cone
	photopigment, and it seems highly probable that the reduction in
	dim-flash sensitivity results from pigment depletion.},

	signal, indicating a receptoral origin for the ATR. The increase
	of ATR amplitude (A/Amax) with flash intensity (R*/R, where R indicates
	rhodopsin) is described by A/Amax = (1- e-kR*/R), with R*/R = k-1
	occurring on generation of approximately two photoactivated rhodopsins

	light and bright flashes reversibly depress the ATR. Kinetic and
	sensitivity data suggest a basis of the ATR in stochastic, unit activation
	events, each initiated by a single R*. They further suggest an essential
	invariance of the unit event under differing conditions of illumination.
	A delay, apparently governed by the lifetime of a light-activated
	substance regulating ATR generation, precedes ATR recovery after
	a bright flash. The flash dependence of the delay period indicates
	an upper limit of 3 s for the lifetime of R* in the ATR-generating
	process. The unit event appears to be an R*-catalyzed and disc-localized

	the problem of extracting histological parameters from spectral reflectance
	measurements. These implications are discussed and a novel approach

	such measurements make a series of assumptions concerning the amount
	of scattered light to derive an estimate of the true cone photopigment

	made three types of measurements of the light returning from the
	eye before and after bleaching: the amount of light returning in
	the “directed” reflection, which is a double-pass estimate of the
	cone photopigment density; the amount of light in undirected or diffuse
	reflection; and the amount of fluorescence from lipofuscin in the
	RPE, which provides a single-pass measurement of optical density
	difference. For a 1 deg foveally fixated field, the density difference
	estimates for the three measurements were 0.68, 0.21, and 0.22 respectively.
	The lipofuscin fluorescence was found to be unguided. The background
	density difference was non-negligible and very close to the single
	pass estimate from fluorescence. These measurements each involve
	potentially different pathways of light through the retina, and therefore
	place different constraints on models of these pathways. A simple
	model comparing the directional and the fluorescence optical densities
	produced retinal coverage estimates around 70–75\%. Estimates of
	the shape factor of the single pass optical Stiles–Crawford effect
	were evaluated from the dark-adapted and bleached fluorescence measurements.
	The values were closer to those obtained from psychophysical methods

  abstract = {We can summarize our investigation of amplification in the activation
	steps of vertebrate phototransduction as follows. (1) A theoretical
	analysis of the activation steps of the cGMP cascade shows that after
	a brief flash of phi photoisomerizations the number of activated
	PDE molecules should rise as a delayed ramp with slope proportional
	to phi, and that, as a consequence, the cGMP-activated current should
	decay as a delayed Gaussian function of time (Eqn. 20). (i) Early
	in the response to a flash, the normalized response R(t) can be approximated
	as rising as 1/2 phi At2 (after a short delay), where A is the amplification
	constant characteristic of the individual photoreceptor. (ii) The
	delayed ramp behavior of PDE activation and the consequent decline
	of current in the form of the delayed Gaussian are confirmed by experiments
	in a variety of photoreceptors; the analysis thus yields estimates
	of the amplification constant from these diverse photoreceptors.
	(iii) Eqn. 20 further predicts that the response-intensity relation
	at any fixed time should saturate exponentially, as has been found
	experimentally. (2) The amplification constant A can be expressed
	as the product of amplification factors contributed by the individual
	activation steps of phototransduction, i.e., A = nu RG cGP beta sub
	n (Eqns. 9 and 21), where (i) nu RG is the rate of G* production
	per Rh*; (ii) cGP is the efficiency of the coupling between G* production
	and PDE* production; (iii) beta sub is the increment in hydrolytic
	rate constant produced by one PDE*, i.e., a single activated catalytic
	subunit of PDE; and (iv) n is the Hill coefficient of opening of
	the cGMP-activated channels. (3) The amplification factor beta sub
	includes the ratio kcat/Km, which characterizes the hydrolytic activity
	of the PDE in vivo where cG << Km. Two different analyses based upon
	photocurrents were developed which provide lower bounds for kcat/Km
	in vivo; these analyses establish that kcat/Km probably exceeds 10(7)
	M-1 s-1 (and is likely to be higher) in both amphibian and mammalian
	rods. Few biochemical studies (other than those using trypsin activation)
	have yielded such high values. A likely explanation of many of the
	relatively low biochemical estimates of kcat/Km is that Km may have
	been overestimated by a factor of about 4 in preparations in which
	stacks of disks are left intact, due to diffusion with hydrolysis
	in the stacks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  year = {2003},
  volume = {44},
  pages = {3233},
  number = {7},
  abstract = {PURPOSE. To determine the variations with eccentricity of the primate
	photopic ERG and to separate contributions by different retinal cells
	by using intravitreal pharmacologic agents.
	
	METHODS. Slow-sequence multifocal (mf)ERGs were obtained from 19 anesthetized
	adult rhesus monkeys and 5 normal human subjects. Recordings in monkeys
	were obtained before and after injections of tetrodotoxin citrate
	(TTX) to block sodium-dependent spiking; TTX+N-methyl-D-aspartic
	acid (NMDA)+picrotoxin (PTX) or {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
	to block all inner retinal activity; L-2 amino-4-phosphonobutyric
	acid (APB) to block the On-pathway; and cis-2, 3 piperidine dicarboxylic
	acid (PDA) to block the Off-pathway and the otherwise unblocked inner
	retinal activity. The stimulus consisted of 103 equal-sized hexagons
	within 17° of the fovea; every 200 ms (15 frames), each hexagon had
	a 50\% chance of remaining at 20 cd/m2 or increasing briefly to 4.7
	cd-s/m2. Oscillatory potentials (OPs; 90–300 Hz) were extracted.
	
	RESULTS. The slow-sequence mfERG summed over the stimulated area looked
	similar to a standard photopic, full-field ERG, with a- and b-waves
	and OPs. OPs in the foveal and temporal retina were larger than in
	the nasal retina. This nasotemporal asymmetry was removed by TTX,
	and the OPs were eliminated, either by blocking inner retina activity
	or by blocking the On-pathway. The summed mfERG waveform, including
	OPs, was shaped mainly by the more peripheral retinal regions. The
	foveal b-wave peak occurred about 5 to 6 ms later than in the periphery,
	with the depolarizing peak of the On-pathway/bipolar contribution
	occurring earlier than the depolarizing peak of the Off contribution
	at all eccentricities. The a-wave was composed of a small photoreceptor
	contribution and postreceptoral portion originating from hyperpolarizing
	neurons.
	
	CONCLUSIONS. The variations in the primate photopic ERG with eccentricity
	are due to spike-driven oscillatory activity that is more prominent
	in central and temporal retina than in nasal retina and to the slower
	timing of all responses in the central, compared with the peripheral,
	retina. The full-field, photopic ERG most closely resembles the mfERG
	responses to stimulation of peripheral regions.},

	on Photopigment Bleaching},
  journal = IOVS,
  year = {2005},
  volume = {46},
  note = {E-abstract 3546},
  abstract = {Purpose: Dynamic fluctuation in the reflectance of single cones has
	been reported to occur over periods of minutes to many hours in the
	living eye. The cause of these fluctuations is unknown, although
	a relationship to disc shedding has been suggested. Current interpretation
	of these fluctuations, however, implicitly assumes the cone reflectance
	is stable over shorter periods (secs), which has not been reported.
	In light of this shortcoming, the reflectance of single cones with
	various initial bleached states was monitored over a period of a
	few seconds using the Indiana adaptive optics (AO) retina camera.
	
	
	Methods: The AO system dynamically corrected the most significant
	aberrations across a 6 mm pupil. For the purposes of imaging and
	bleaching cones, a 670 nm light source illuminated a 1.5 deg retinal
	patch at 1.4 deg ecc. Cone images of 2 msec duration were acquired
	at 24 Hz over 4 sec intervals. The 24 Hz strobing light also acted
	as a bleaching source providing 78x106 trolands and bleaching 99\%
	of the cone photopigment after 2 sec. Two experiments were conducted.
	First, cones in the 1.5 deg patch were initially bleached to levels
	of 100\%, 75\%, 50\%, and 0\% and then immediately imaged over a
	4 sec interval to monitor cone reflectance as described above. The
	second experiment was identical to the first except bleached and
	unbleached cone patches were imaged simultaneously to avoid unwanted
	variance that might have arisen in experiment one. Fluctuations in
	the retinal reflectance were assessed at both the level of individual
	cones and across large patches containing many cones.
	
	
	Results: In both experiments, the reflectance from large patches of
	cones roughly followed the conventional bleaching time course with
	maximum reflectance being reached in about 2 sec for an initially
	unbleached retina. The reflectance of many of the single cones, however,
	noticeably deviated from this time course, oscillating, often significantly,
	with a typical period of about 1 sec. The temporal RMS of the reflectance
	for each pixel in the cone videos vividly revealed that fluctuations
	were localized to cone apertures rather than gaps between cones.
	The number of cones that fluctuated in a given patch of retina depended
	on the bleaching state, with fully regenerated cones providing the
	most variation.
	
	
	Conclusions: Contrary to the conventional time course for photopigment
	bleaching, the reflectance of some single cones was observed to fluctuate,
	often significantly, over periods of about 1 sec. Although we do
	not know the source of this new phenomenon, it appears localized
	to light exiting individual cones and dependent on the cone bleaching
	state.},

  abstract = {The electroretinogram (ERG) of anaesthetised dark-adapted macaque
	monkeys was recorded in response to ganzfeld stimulation and rod-
	and cone-driven receptoral and postreceptoral components were separated
	and modelled. The test stimuli were brief (< 4.1 ms) flashes. The
	cone-driven component was isolated by delivering the stimulus shortly
	after a rod-saturating background had been extinguished. The rod-driven
	component was derived by subtracting the cone-driven component from
	the mixed rod-cone ERG. The initial part of the leading edge of the
	rod-driven a-wave scaled linearly with stimulus energy when energy
	was sufficiently low and, for times less than about 12 ms after the
	stimulus, it was well described by a linear model incorporating a
	distributed delay and three cascaded low-pass filter elements. Addition
	of a simple static saturating non-linearity with a characteristic
	intermediate between a hyperbolic and an exponential function was
	sufficient to extend application of the model to most of the leading
	edge of the saturated responses to high energy stimuli. It was not
	necessary to assume involvement of any other non-linearity or that
	any significant low-pass filter followed the non-linear stage of
	the model. A negative inner-retinal component contributed to the
	later part of the rod-driven a-wave. After suppressing this component
	by blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors, the entire a-wave up
	to the time of the first zero-crossing scaled with stimulus energy
	and was well described by summing the response of the rod model with
	that of a model describing the leading edge of the rod-bipolar cell
	response. The negative inner-retinal component essentially cancelled
	the early part of the rod-bipolar cell component and, for stimuli
	of moderate energy, made it appear that the photoreceptor current
	was the only significant component of the leading edge of the a-wave.
	The leading edge of the cone-driven a-wave included a slow phase
	that continued up to the peak, and was reduced in amplitude either
	by a rod-suppressing background or by the glutamate analogue, cis-piperidine-2,3-dicarboxylic
	acid (PDA). Thus the slow phase represents a postreceptoral component
	present in addition to a fast component of the a-wave generated by
	the cones themselves. At high stimulus energies, it appeared less
	than 5 ms after the stimulus. The leading edge of the cone-driven
	a-wave was adequately modelled as the sum of the output of a cone
	photoreceptor model similar to that for rods and a postreceptoral
	signal obtained by a single integration of the cone output. In addition,
	the output of the static non-linear stage in the cone model was subject
	to a low-pass filter with a time constant of no more than 1 ms. In
	conclusion, postreceptoral components must be taken into account
	when interpreting the leading edge of the rod- and cone-driven a-waves
	of the dark-adapted ERG.},

	disk membranes (binding signal or signalP). The signal measured on
	isolated disks (so-calledP D signal) is exactly stoichiometric in
	its final level to bound G-protein but its kinetics are much slower
	than theR M G binding reaction. In this study on isolated disks,
	recombined with G-protein, we analyzed theP D -signal level and kinetics
	as a function of flash intensity and compared it to theR M G-complex
	formation monitored spectroscopically (by extra metarhodopsin II).
	The basic observation is that the initial slopes of theP D signals
	decrease with flash intensity when the signals are normalized to
	the same final level. This finding prevents an explanation of the
	scattering signal by a slow postponed reaction of theR M G complex.
	We propose to interpret the scattering change as a redistribution
	of G-protein between a membrane-bound and a solved state. The process
	is driven by the complexation of membrane-bound G to flash-activated
	rhodopsin (R M ). The experimental evidence for this two-state model
	is the following: (1) The intensity dependence of the initial rate
	of theP D signal is explained by the model. Under the assumption
	of a bimolecular reaction of free G with sites at the membrane, equal
	to rhodopsin in their concentration, the measured rates yield aK
	D of 10–5 M. (2) Evaluation of the extra MII kinetics yields a biphasic
	rise at saturating flashes. The measured rates fit to the supply
	of free and membrane-bound G-protein for the reaction withR M . (3)
	Quantitative estimation of the expected scattering intensity changes
	gives a comprehensive description of binding signal and dissociation
	signal by the gain and loss of G-protein scattering mass. (4) The
	temperature dependence of theP D -signal rate leads to an activation
	energy of the membrane-association process ofE a =44 kJ/mol.},

	death in the aging retina could account for much of the amplitude
	decline that is observed with age. In diabetic retinopathy, the oscillatory
	potentials can monitor the progression of the disease and indicate
	neuronal alterations rather than diabetic angiopathy of the retina.
	Human ERG studies on glaucoma concentrated on ERG measures that are
	dominated by inner retinal contributions. It has been shown that
	the pattern ERG can serve as a predictor of ocular hypertension's
	progression to glaucoma. In retinal disorders caused by endogenous
	intoxication, such as hepatic retinopathy, or exogenous intoxication
	from chronic lead exposure, ERG changes give an objective measure
	of the damage and allow to study the pathophysiological mechanisms
	that are involved. Inflammations of the choroid and the retina affect
	the standard ERG when they are diffuse. In central serous chorioretinopathy,
	functional disturbances can be revealed not only in the photoreceptors

	stimuli. Choroidal melanoma leads to large reductions of the EOG
	light peak–to–dark trough ratio through its influence on the transepithelial
	potential of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In cancer-associated
	retinopathy, both the rod and cone ERGs are reduced. However, selective
	cone dysfunction has been described. In melanoma-associated retinopathy,
	the long flash ERG may reveal a specific pathophysiological mechanism,
	namely the affection of the ON-pathway with preservation of the OFF-pathway.
	ERG measurements can reveal vitamin A deficiency and are altered
	in cases with a mutation in the gene for the retinol binding protein

	(minimum) flicker photometric data obtained from 40 observers (35
	males, 5 females) of known genotype, 22 with the serine variant L(ser180),

	of the new function are as follows: it forms a consistent set with
	the new proposed CIE cone fundamentals (which are the Stockman &
	Sharpe 2000 cone fundamentals); it is based solely on flicker photometry,
	which is the standard method for defining luminance; it corresponds
	to a central 2° viewing field, for which the basic laws of brightness
	matching are valid for flicker photometry; its composition of the
	serine/alanine L-cone pigment polymorphism (58:42) closely matches
	the reported incidence in the normal population (56:44; Stockman
	& Sharpe, 1999); and it specifies luminance for a reproducible, standard
	daylight condition. V*(λ) is defined as 1.55L(λ)+M(λ), where L(λ)

  abstract = {Review of the results of a complete electromagnetic theory analysis
	of a foveal cone photoreceptor, including the effects of the tapered
	inner segment (or ellipsoid) and the absorbing photopigment in the
	outer segment. It is shown that an isolated individual foveal cone
	can produce the Stiles-Crawford (1933) effect in all its detail.
	The dependence of the phenomenon on changes in the diameter and index
	of refraction of the inner and outer segments is pointed out. It
	is also shown that the variation of this effect with wavelength is
	due to diffraction and interference associated with dielectric waveguide
	mode propagation on the outer segments. Direct psychophysical evidence
	of mode propagation in the human retina is thus provided in addition
	to a detailed description of the Stiles-Crawford effect.},

  abstract = {We determined the accuracy and precision of 33 objective methods for
	predicting the results of conventional, sphero-cylindrical refraction
	from wavefront aberrations in a large population of 200 eyes. Accuracy
	for predicting defocus (as specified by the population mean error
	of prediction) varied from –0.50 D to +0.25 D across methods. Precision
	of these estimates (as specified by 95% limits of agreement) ranged
	from 0.5 to 1.0 D. All methods except one accurately predicted astigmatism
	to within ±1/8D. Precision of astigmatism predictions was typically
	better than precision for predicting defocus and many methods were
	better than 0.5D. Paraxial curvature matching of the wavefront aberration
	map was the most accurate method for determining the spherical equivalent
	error whereas least-squares fitting of the wavefront was one of the
	least accurate methods. We argue that this result was obtained because
	curvature matching is a biased method that successfully predicts
	the biased endpoint stipulated by conventional refractions. Five
	methods emerged as reasonably accurate and among the most precise.
	Three of these were based on pupil plane metrics and two were based
	on image plane metrics. We argue that the accuracy of all methods
	might be improved by correcting for the systematic bias reported
	in this study. However, caution is advised because some tasks, including
	conventional refraction of defocus, require a biased metric whereas
	other tasks, such as refraction of astigmatism, are unbiased. We
	conclude that objective methods of refraction based on wavefront
	aberration maps can accurately predict the results of subjective
	refraction and may be more precise. If objective refractions are
	more precise than subjective refractions, then wavefront methods
	may become the new gold standard for specifying conventional and/or
	optimal corrections of refractive errors. },

  abstract = {A Shack–Hartmann aberrometer was used to measure the monochromatic
	aberration structure along the primary line of sight of 200 cyclopleged,
	normal, healthy eyes from 100 individuals. Sphero-cylindrical refractive
	errors were corrected with ophthalmic spectacle lenses based on the
	results of a subjective refraction performed immediately prior to
	experimentation. Zernike expansions of the experimental wave-front
	aberration functions were used to determine aberration coefficients
	for a series of pupil diameters. The residual Zernike coefficients
	for defocus were not zero but varied systematically with pupil diameter
	and with the Zernike coefficient for spherical aberration in a way
	that maximizes visual acuity. We infer from these results that subjective
	best focus occurs when the area of the central, aberration-free region
	of the pupil is maximized. We found that the population averages
	of Zernike coefficients were nearly zero for all of the higher-order
	modes except spherical aberration. This result indicates that a hypothetical
	average eye representing the central tendency of the population is
	nearly free of aberrations, suggesting the possible influence of
	an emmetropization process or evolutionary pressure. However, for
	any individual eye the aberration coefficients were rarely zero for
	any Zernike mode. To first approximation, wave-front error fell exponentially
	with Zernike order and increased linearly with pupil area. On average,
	the total wave-front variance produced by higher-order aberrations
	was less than the wave-front variance of residual defocus and astigmatism.
	For example, the average amount of higher-order aberrations present
	for a 7.5-mm pupil was equivalent to the wave-front error produced
	by less than 1/4 diopter (D) of defocus. The largest pupil for which
	an eye may be considered diffraction-limited was 1.22 mm on average.
	Correlation of aberrations from the left and right eyes indicated
	the presence of significant bilateral symmetry. No evidence was found
	of a universal anatomical feature responsible for third-order optical
	aberrations. Using the Marechal criterion, we conclude that correction
	of the 12 largest principal components, or 14 largest Zernike modes,
	would be required to achieve diffraction-limited performance on average
	for a 6-mm pupil. Different methods of computing population averages
	provided upper and lower limits to the mean optical transfer function
	and mean point-spread function for our population of eyes.},

	the major differences between the systems relates to the nature of
	the stimulus. In both the visual and olfactory systems a quantal
	mechanism of detection is possible, because the absorption of a photon
	or the binding of an odorant molecule provides an energy change significantly
	greater than the thermal noise in the receptor molecule. In hearing,
	on the other hand, the energy of a phonon is far lower, and detection
	occurs by a "classical" mechanism. For vertebrate photoreceptors
	and olfactory receptor cells, sensory transduction employs a G protein
	cascade that is remarkably similar in the two cases, and that is
	closely homologous to other G protein signaling cascades. For auditory
	and vestibular hair cells, transduction operates via a mechanism
	of direct coupling of the stimulus to ion channels, in a manner reminiscent
	of the direct gating of post-synaptic ion channels in various synaptic
	mechanisms. The three classes of sensory receptor cell share similarities

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examines a patient with cone-rod dystrophy using
	high-resolution adaptive optics retinal imaging. Conventional ophthalmoscopes
	provide limited resolution due to their inability to overcome the
	eye's optical aberrations. In contrast, adaptive optics ophthalmoscopes
	correct these aberrations to provide noninvasive high-resolution
	views of the living retina. To date, adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy
	has been used mainly to examine the normal retina. Here we use adaptive
	optics ophthalmoscopy to image cone-rod dystrophy in vivo and compare
	these results with standard clinical tests. DESIGN: Observational
	case report. METHODS: High-resolution retinal images of a patient
	with cone-rod dystrophy were obtained with the University of Rochester
	adaptive optics flood-illuminated ophthalmoscope and the adaptive
	optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope located at the University of
	Houston and compared with standard clinical tests, including fundus
	photography, Goldmann visual fields, fluorescein angiography, optical
	coherence tomography, electroretinography, and multifocal electroretinography.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Direct measurement of cone density and diameter
	and comparison of adaptive optics images with standard clinical imaging
	and functional tests. RESULTS: Adaptive optics images were acquired
	at multiple retinal locations throughout a clinically detected bull's-eye
	lesion. Within the atrophic regions, we observed large areas devoid
	of wave-guiding cones. In contrast, regions that appeared relatively
	spared by clinical examination contained a completely tiled cone
	mosaic. However, in these areas the cones were abnormally large,
	resulting in a 6.6-fold reduction from the normal peak cone density
	(patient peak density: 30 100 cones/mm2, normal peak density: 199

	of the toad, Bufo marinus, with a low-Ca2+ (10(-8) M), low-Cl- Ringer's
	solution containing 0.5 mM ouabain. Under these conditions, the membrane
	potential of the rod is near zero and there is no light- induced
	potential change either in the rod or in more proximal neurons. The
	photoreceptors, however, continue to show a light-dependent increase
	in membrane resistance, which indicates that the light- sensitive
	channels still close with illumination. Dark-adapted retinas show
	a larger 22Na+ accumulation than do light-adapted retinas. The extra
	accumulation of 22Na+ into dark-adapted retinas can be removed if
	the retinas are washed in darkness with low-Ca2+ Ringer's solutions,
	or if the ionophore gramicidin D is present in the perfusate. The
	additional accumulation in dark retinas corresponds to a flux of
	at least 10(9) Na+ per receptor per second, which is close to the
	value of the photoreceptor dark current. The light-dependent uptake
	of 22Na+ can be prevented by exposing the retinas to Ca2+ during
	the incubation period, but is restored if the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
	IBMX is added to the perfusate. A significant light-dependent ion
	accumulation can be observed for the cations K+, Rb+, Cs+, and Tl+,
	in addition to Na+, but not for methylamine, choline, or tetraethylammonium.},

  abstract = {Although optical coherence tomography (OCT) can axially resolve and
	detect reflections from individual cells, there are no reports of
	imaging cells in the living human retina using OCT. To supplement
	the axial resolution and sensitivity of OCT with the necessary lateral
	resolution and speed, we developed a novel spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT)
	camera based on a free-space parallel illumination architecture and
	equipped with adaptive optics (AO). Conventional flood illumination,
	also with AO, was integrated into the camera and provided confirmation
	of the focus position in the retina with an accuracy of ±10.3 μm.
	Short bursts of narrow B-scans (100x560 μm) of the living retina
	were subsequently acquired at 500 Hz during dynamic compensation
	(up to 14 Hz) that successfully corrected the most significant ocular
	aberrations across a dilated 6 mm pupil. Camera sensitivity (up to
	94 dB) was sufficient for observing reflections from essentially
	all neural layers of the retina. Signal-to-noise of the detected
	reflection from the photoreceptor layer was highly sensitive to the
	level of cular aberrations and defocus with changes of 11.4 and 13.1
	dB (single pass) observed when the ocular aberrations (astigmatism,
	3rd order and higher) were corrected and when the focus was shifted
	by 200 μm (0.54 diopters) in the retina, respectively. The 3D resolution
	of the B-scans (3.0x3.0x5.7 μm) is the highest reported to date in
	the living human eye and was sufficient to observe the interface
	between the inner and outer segments of individual photoreceptor
	cells, resolved in both lateral and axial dimensions. However, high
	contrast speckle, which is intrinsic to OCT, was present throughout
	the AO parallel SD-OCT B-scans and obstructed correlating retinal
	reflections to cell-sized retinal structures.},

	in the presence of residual wave aberrations, which is inversely
	proportional to square root of the Strehl ratio. The modeling, while
	not sufficient in describing the fine structure of the real PSF,
	demonstrates good conformance to the lateral cross section of the
	real PSF. With this model, the lateral resolution of our current
	AOSLO was computed to be 1.65 to 2.33 µm, which agreed well with
